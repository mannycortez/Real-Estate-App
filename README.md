This is a real estate listing and social network app similar to AirBnB, but catered specifically for digital nomads.  A digital nomad is someone who travels and works remotely; usually as a designer, writer or developer.  The app can help travelers find available rooms, apartments and houses in the area and their hosts are fellow digital nomads.  Both hosts and travelers are able to create profiles and rate each other's experiences similar to Uber/Lyft.  Hosts are also able to upload any available job or volunteer opportunities for travelers who are looking to stay for an extended time.  The traveler would work part-time for the host in exchange for a free place to stay.

This app is created with React and makes use of react-router for routing and context API for state management.  It also makes use of the new React Hooks, as well as CSS Grid and features icons from react-icons. This project features a powerful filter and search functionality using context API that's easy to maintain and update.

To do list:

1) Create a log-in functionality that allow both hosts and travelers to create a profile.  Hosts are able to upload information on available rooms and users are able to browse through different listings.  All users are able to log-in using their Facebook account.

2) Create an interactive map using the Google Maps API that would allow travelers to find available hosts in the area.  

3) Create a booking system using the Calendly API that would enable travelers to find available rooms on a calendar and reserve it online with a credit card.  Hosts are able to update their calendar and create notifications for travelers who are on a waiting list.
